# Welcome to OSGeoLabUD's GeoAI Lab Repository
GeoAI UD Lab is a set of human, technological, educational and bibliographic resources to carry out research, experiences, practices and academic work related to Geospatial Artificial Intelligence. It is located in the Faculty of Engineering of the Universidad Distrital Francisco Jos√© de Caldas.

## Objetives

* To provide a set of open resources for those interested in GeoAI research, study, teaching and learning.
* To foster an environment of academic excellence, collaboration and open source exchange that allows students, researchers and practitioners to explore the rationale, methods, techniques and tools of GeoAI.
* To research, analyse, define and co-construct models for the application of artificial intelligence to the geospatial domain.

## Mission
The mission of the GeoAI UD Lab is to be active partners in the transformative advances in geospatial artificial intelligence by providing an inclusive and dynamic ecosystem of open resources. We are dedicated to cultivating a diverse community of students, educators, and researchers who collaborate on research, educational practices, and the co-creation of GeoAI solutions. Our commitment extends to promoting the ethical use of open geospatial data and open AI technologies to address global challenges, and support social progress and environmental protection.

## Vision
By 2030, the GeoAI UD Lab envisions being a critical contributor to the field of geospatial artificial intelligence, known for its robust and ethical integration of AI with geospatial technologies. We aim to equip researchers, professionals, and policymakers globally with advanced tools and methodologies that enhance their ability to make informed, data-driven decisions for sustainable development. Through strong partnerships and a commitment to open-source education, our lab will support the widespread adoption and effective use of GeoAI solutions, thereby fostering environmental stewardship and societal advancement.
